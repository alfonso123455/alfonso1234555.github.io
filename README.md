this proyect was made for an app in python with the library of streamlit, where you can get the basic information of the pokemons,
because the API chosen was pokeapi2
you have the options of writing a name of a pokemon you know, so you can take a look at a picture of the pokemon you wrote
with the height, the weight and the type of pokemon
also, there is the option of a button where if you click it, a random pokemon appears with also the image, height, weight and the type of pokemon
